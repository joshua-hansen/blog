## First Post

I managed to get my personal website working at [joshuaha.dev][personal-website]!
This site uses a theme from Pixelarity which I contributed to for a full user license. The website
itself is published on GitHub pages where it's code is publicly availble [here][personal-website-code].

I learned how to incorporate other scripts so I'm using [repo-card][repo-card] from Tarptaeya! This
is great, because I can now easily include any new repositories in the future.

I created this blog and personal website to keep me dedicated to writing more code. I want to create
more personal projects and even begin contributing to open source software. To kick things off I'll
start [100days of code][100days] after this blog is fully published.

The next blog post should be of this blog site actually up and running, be sure to follow that next!

*P.S. maybe this will help me become a better writer too...*
