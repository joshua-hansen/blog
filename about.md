Thank you for stopping by and checking out my dev blog! My name is Joshua Hansen and I'm a Software Engineer.
This has been my profession since 2019. I currently work for Target Coporation in back-end infrastructure
development.

I have a lot of passions outside of work as well. I enjoy riding my bike and working on cars. I drive a Mazda 3
that is a manual transmission and being from the United States that's not a common thing to see! I take my bike
on local trails and take some single-track as well. Outside of these two hobbies I'm now a new father of
a baby boy. He is just awesome to be around! I'm enjoying all life has to offer at the moment :D
